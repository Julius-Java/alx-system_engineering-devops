Problems with this infrastructure

SPOF: 
Since the infrastructure is a single server web infrastructure, it means if any layer fails or experience downtime, the whole system fails

Downtime when maintenance is needed:
System maintenance will cause a major problem considering that it is a single web server, no other server to handle incoming requests

This infrastructure cannot handle too much incoming traffic because it has only a single server therefore too much incoming request will increase response time tremedously.
